   abstract = {This paper creates and analyses a new quantum algorithm called the Amplified Quantum Fourier Transform (Amplified-QFT) for solving the following problem: The Local Period Problem: Let L = \{0,1...N-1\} be a set of N labels and let A be a subset of M labels of period P, i.e. a subset of the form A = \{j : j = s + rP; r = 0,1...M-1\} where P < sqrt(N) and M << N, and where M is assumed known. Given an oracle f : L->\{0,1\} which is 1 on A and 0 elsewhere, find the local period P. A separate algorithm finds the offset s. The first part of the paper defines the Amplified-QFT algorithm. The second part of the paper summarizes the main results and compares the Amplified-QFT algorithm against the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Hidden Subgroup (QHS) algorithms when solving the local period problem. It is shown that the Amplified-QFT is, on average, quadratically faster than both the QFT and QHS algorithms. The third part of the paper provides the detailed proofs of the main results, describes the method of recovering P from an observation y and describes the method for recovering the offset s.},

   abstract = {The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) can calculate the Fourier transform of a vector of size N with time complexity O(log 2 N) as compared to the classical complexity of O(N log N). However, if one wanted to measure the full output state, then the QFT complexity becomes O(N log 2 N), thus losing its apparent advantage, indicating that the advantage is fully exploited for algorithms when only a limited number of samples is required from the output vector, as is the case in many quantum algorithms. Moreover, the computational complexity worsens if one considers the complexity of constructing the initial state. In this paper, this issue is better illustrated by providing a concrete implementation of these algorithms and discussing their complexities as well as the complexity of the simulation of the QFT in MATLAB. The principles of quantum computing Quantum computation poses a fundamentally different framework than our more familiar classical computation. Specifically, this is due to the existence of qubits, as opposed to bits, the fundamental components of computing. Whereas bits can only hold the binary values of 0 or 1, qubits can instead hold a superposition of states. We use Dirac's bra-ket notation, which utilizes two kets analogous to the classical states 0 and 1, to represent an orthogonal basis, |0 = 1 0 and |1 = 0 1. (1) A more generic qubit state is a superposition of the previous basis states: |Ïˆ = x 0 |0 + x 1 |1. (2) where x 0 and x 1 are complex-valued amplitudes obeying the relation: |x 0 | 2 + |x 1 | 2 = 1. (3) It is important to clarify that such a superposition does not take a value "in between 0 and 1": instead, in accordance with the Born rule(Born, 1954), a measurement of the state of the qubit corresponds to a binary value. The qubit has a probability |x 0 | 2 to be found in state "0" and a probability |x 1 | 2 to be found in state "1." We can use the Kronecker tensor product to construct the basis of a system comprised of multiple (n) qubits. For example, the product basis states of a four-dimensional (n = 4) linear vector space are: 1},

   abstract = {Distance measures provide the foundation for many popular algorithms in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. Different notions of distance can be used depending on the types of the data the algorithm is working on. For graph-shaped data, an important notion is the Graph Edit Distance (GED) that measures the degree of (dis)similarity between two graphs in terms of the operations needed to make them identical. As the complexity of computing GED is the same as NP-hard problems, it is reasonable to consider approximate solutions. In this paper we present a QUBO formulation of the GED problem. This allows us to implement two different approaches, namely quantum annealing and variational quantum algorithms that run on the two types of quantum hardware currently available: quantum annealer and gate-based quantum computer, respectively. Considering the current state of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, we base our study on proof-of-principle tests of their performance.},

We propose a quantum-assisted compact genetic algorithm that uses a quantum amplitude amplification technique in the selection process to circumvent the said problem. In addition to using elitism mechanics where a single best candidate solution is kept to drive the probability vector, the amplitude amplification subroutine also acts as a mutation operator which, with high probability, enforces the constraint that the newly generated candidate is a feasible solution. We demonstrate this idea by applying the algorithm to the traveling salesman problem of size 3 and 4 cities on IBM Qiskit simulator to show how one would con-struct the quantum circuit and how to encode the optimization problem into quantum states via Ising spin model encoding. We then show space and time complexity analysis based on the quantum circuit model. Finally, we discuss the number of qubits required for encoding, gate counts in the circuit model, and the practicality of applying this to a small-scale devices in the future.},

This research aims to parallelize the computation involved in the algorithm to speed up the performance using CUDA. However, there is a data dependency issue due to the property of a dynamic programming algorithm. As a solution, this research introduces the heterogeneous anti-diagonal approach, which benefits from the interaction between the serial implementation on CPU and the parallel implementation on GPU. We then measure and compare the computation time between the proposed approach and a straightforward serial approach that uses CPU only. Measurements of computation times are performed under the same experimental setup and using various pairwise sequences at different lengths. The experiment showed that the proposed approach outperforms the serial method in terms of computation time by approximately three times. Moreover, the computation time of the proposed heterogeneous anti-diagonal approach increases gradually despite the big increments in sequence length, whereas the computation time of the serial approach grows rapidly.},

The amount of DNA data grows very fast, and many new genomes are waiting to be sequenced while millions of private genomes need to be re-sequenced. Each human genome has 3.2B base pairs, and each one could be stored with 2 bits of information, so one human genome would take 6.4B bits or ~760MB of storage ("National Institute of General Medical Sciences," n.d.). Today's most powerful tensor processing units cannot handle the volume of DNA data necessitating a major leap in computing power. It is, therefore, important to investigate the usefulness of quantum computers in genomic data analysis, especially in DNA sequence alignment. Quantum computers are expected to be involved in DNA sequencing, initially as parts of classical systems, acting as quantum accelerators. The number of available qubits is increasing annually, and future quantum computers could conduct DNA sequencing, taking the place of classical computing systems. We present a novel quantum algorithm for reference-guided DNA sequence alignment modeled with gate-based quantum computing. The algorithm is scalable, can be integrated into existing classical DNA sequencing systems and is intentionally structured to limit computational errors. The quantum algorithm has been tested using the quantum processing units and simulators provided by IBM Quantum, and its correctness has been confirmed.},

   abstract = {The 3-dimensional fold of an RNA molecule is largely determined by patterns of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between bases. Predicting the base pairing network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary and machine learning algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of consecutive base pairs while jointly maximizing the average length of the stems. A Quantum Annealer (QA) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the QA being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and, despite its simplicity, was found to be competitive on a test set containing known structures with pseudoknots.},

Recent strides have been taken to apply this computational framework in tackling and resolving various issues related to text processing. The resultant solutions demonstrate marked advantages over their classical counterparts. This study employs quantum computation to efficaciously surmount text processing challenges, particularly those involving string comparison. The focus is on the alignment of fixed-length substrings within two input strings. Specifically, given two input strings, $x$ and $y$, both of length $n$, and a value $d \leq n$, we want to verify the following conditions: the existence of a common prefix of length $d$, the presence of a common substring of length $d$ beginning at position $j$ (with $0 \leq j < n$) and, the presence of any common substring of length $d$ beginning in both strings at the same position. Such problems find applications as sub-procedures in a variety of problems concerning text processing and sequence analysis. Notably, our approach furnishes polylogarithmic solutions, a stark contrast to the linear complexity inherent in the best classical alternatives.},

The content of this book is presented as a set of design methods of quantum circuits with the focus on evolutionary algorithm; however some heuristic algborithms as well as a wide range of application of quantum circuits are provided. The general idea behind this book is to represent every computational problem as a quantum circuit and then to use some classical synthesis approach to design the circuit. The goal of such approach is to describe and illustrate the use of classical design methods and their extension into quantum logic synthesis. The reason of using the circuit representation is that in classical logic synthesis various algorithms exist for the design of both combinatorial and sequential circuits and thus designing quantum algorithms in the circuit representation provides a good basis for comparison. Moreover the circuit representation is one that is the most explicit; at the same time it provides a good visual representation as well as it also allows a direct formalization and generalization of principles of both quantum computation and circuit design. We know that Quantum Computation relies on quantum mechanics which is a mathematical model that describes the evolution of physical realization of computation and hence the computer itself.

The model we adopt is a quantum state machine, which is a natural quantum generalisation of Mealy machines. A major difficulty in checking quantum circuits (but not present in checking classical circuits) is that the state spaces of quantum circuits are continuums. This difficulty is resolved by our main theorem showing that equivalence checking of two quantum Mealy machines can be done with input sequences that are taken from some chosen basis (which are finite) and have a length quadratic in the dimensions of the state Hilbert spaces of the machines. Based on this theoretical result, we develop an (and to the best of our knowledge, the first) algorithm for checking equivalence of sequential quantum circuits with running time $\mathcal\{O\}(2^\{3m+5l\}(2^\{3m\}+2^\{3l\}))$, where $m$ and $l$ denote the numbers of input and internal qubits, respectively.

One particular approach to string matching problem is the semi-numerical approach of viewing pattern matching as the process of multiplying polynomials. A classical technique used for speeding up multiplication is the convolution method which uses Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse. The Fast Fourier Transform algorithm can be used to speed up computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform by a large factor. In this paper we propose a quantum algorithm which applies the classical convolution method to pattern matching but uses Quantum Fourier Transform for computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform instead of the classical Fast Fourier Transform.

Through theoretical analysis, a bound on the ratio of the number of feasible states to the size of the Hilbert space is determined. Furthermore, we consider a small instance of our QAOA-MSA algorithm in both a quantum simulator and its performance on an actual quantum computer. While the ideal solution to the instance of MSA investigated is shown to be the most probable state sampled for a shallow p<5 quantum circuit in the simulation, the level of noise in current devices is still a formidable challenge for the kind of MSA-QAOA algorithm developed here. In turn, we are not able to distinguish the feasible solutions from other states in the quantum hardware output data at this point. This indicates a need for further investigation into both the strategy utilized for compiling the quantum circuit, but also the possibility of devising a more compact ansatz, as one might achieve through constraint-preserving mixers for QAOA.},
